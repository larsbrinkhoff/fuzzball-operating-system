                    Requests for copies of PRTNs should be made to the

               authoring company with a carbon copy sent to DARPA

               stating the desired PRTN number(s).  After DARPA

               approval, the authoring company holds the final approval

               for the distribution of their PRTN.




                    Each PRTN entry is followed by the acronym for the

               authoring company.  Complete U.S. Mail and, when

               available, ARPANET addresses for each company can be

               found in the appendix.  Entries without a date had not

               been published at the time of this printing.

               stating the desired SRNTN number(s).  After DARPA

               approval, the authoring company holds the final approval

               for the distribution of their SRNTN.




                    Each SRNTN entry is followed by the acronym for the

               authoring company.  Complete U.S. Mail and, when
