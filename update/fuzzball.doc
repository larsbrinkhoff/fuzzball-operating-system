Dave Mills' Fuzzball operating system is now available via anonymous FTP
from tats.wizvax.com in directory pub/pdp11/fuzzball.

Fuzzball is a timesharing operating system for the PDP-11 with built-in
TCP/IP support.  It seems to be mainly targeted at the 11/23 and 11/73,
but has conditionals for Unibus processors and 18-bit addressing which
seem to work.  However it supports Q-bus better, in particular there is
no DEUNA or DELUA ethernet driver in the system.

The distribution consists of four logical disk files, and RT-11 V5.X
is required to build, boot, and run Fuzzball (it's not self-booting, so
it has to be loaded and run from a running RT-11 system, and once running
it needs RT-11's utility programs to do many common operations).

Configuring the system is not for the faint of heart!  Actually I can't
seem to find any real docs on how to do it, and just so you know it's
done by modifying some assembly language source files and making up .COM
files to assemble the pieces and link them together;  it's not magic but
it could be intimidating to non-programmers.

Also I would imagine that harrassing Mr. Mills for support would be a bad
idea.  And you certainly shouldn't expect *me* to know more than you do!
(You can bug me anyway if you want, I'm certainly willing to *try* to help
figure things out.)  But the sources are pretty well commented and there's
a HELP library which explains the user commands.

One thing is clear from the sources, Mr. Mills really cares about what time
it is!

Anyway have fun, and if you screw up downloading please wait a day before
trying again, I have an agreement with the person whose net my machine is
on to keep usage low and the four disk images are 1MB each uncompressed.
If anyone needs to have the files split out of the LD: images let me know,
but if you can't read the LD:s then you probably can't assemble the files
either.
