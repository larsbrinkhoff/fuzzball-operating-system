						<h4>The Fuzzball </h4>
						<p>The Fuzzball is an operating system and a package of 
applications  for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP11 family 
of computers, including the LSI-11 board-level components. The package 
was conceived in 1971 as a replacement for the RAMP operating system for
 the DEC PDP8 [3]. It later was evolved as a virtual machine supporting 
the DEC RT-11 operating system and early developmental versions of the 
TCP/IP protocol and applications suite. Prototype versions of popular 
Internet tools, including Telnet, FTP, DNS, EGP and SMTP were first 
implemented and tested on the Fuzzball. <i>Fuzzball</i> is now in the <a href="http://computing-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fuzzball">Computing Dictionary</a> and remembered in the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf0050/internet/fuzzball.htm">NSF history archives</a>.</p>

						<p>Fuzzballs were deployed extensively in the DARPA SATNET program
 during the 1970s. Fuzzball nests were deployed at the INTELSAT earth 
stations in the US, UK, Germany, Norway and Italy. Perhaps the best 
known role of the Fuzzball was as routers for the NSFNET Phase-I 
Backbone Network [2], which was deployed during the 1986-1988 time 
period. There were five routers co-located at the five NSF supercomputer
 centers and connected by 56-kbps data circuits. The Fuzzballs carried 
traffic between the centers, the center users and the adjacent college 
campuses. To say the network was gloriously overloaded is an 
understatement, but the system did present an opportunity to study 
methods to defend against massive overload.</p>
						<p>The Fuzzball archive consists of some 16 MB&nbsp;of source code
 and binaries written for the PDP11 Macro Assembler. The last update to 
the archive was in 1992, but it <a href="http://malarky.udel.edu/~dmills/data/du0">survives to the present</a> for curious seekers. </p>
						<p>The Fuzzball itself is described in [1] while the lessons 
learned with NSFNET are discussed in [2]. Perhaps the most important 
lesson  learned was that the best way to defend against supercomputer 
elephants in the company of mice is to find the biggest elephant in the 
forest, shoot it and do this recursively until the forest is safe for 
mice.</p>
