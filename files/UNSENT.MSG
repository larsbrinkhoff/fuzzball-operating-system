Murthy,

Our mail system just turned flake, so I am sending this message
via devious means to make sure you receive my confirmation of
your message that you would meet me at the airport. As I said
in my other message, I have your software on Sun-compatible
tape, but you had better find room for over 61 megabytes.

See you in a couple of nights.

ppose
you want to find the name that goes with IP address 128.6.4.7:

% nslookup

The important thing to note is the reversed order of the address octets.
(That, and the "in-addr.arpa." part.)  What is "thost"?

I got tired of typing all of the in-addr.arpa giberish.  So, here are
the changes to nslookup (bind version 4.8) to do this in the ``natural
way,'' as shown below.

% nslookup

Use "strcasecmp"!!!  Down with unneccessary case-sensitivity!!!!!!

Note that it is valid to look up ("set q=PTR") 
"84.128.in-addr.arpa.", though it currently seems to not
work.  The above query should return PTR record(s), indicating
the hosts that act as gateways to network 128.84.0.0.
(See RFC1033, Page 10 "GATEWAY PTR's").

I suspect the above is a bug in named-  I have an appropriate
PTR record stored at "84.128.in-addr.arpa.", but it doesn't
appear in the named memory dump, nor in the zone transfer.

Subject: Sendmail 5.59 on a Sun 4/280 with Sun OS 4.0


Is anybody out there running Sendmail 5.59 on a Sun 4 with SunOS 4.0?
If so, would you be willing to answer some questions?  If so, please send
me some email with an address (a phone number would be great; I will spend
the dimes).

I am using the normal (as distributed) uucp software, and have installed
the 5.59 sendmail.  I am having problems with incoming uucp mail, related
somehow to uux, rmail, and sendmail.  I get "MAIL FAIL" messages in
/usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE, and 'queuename: Cannot create "qf~Zxxxxx" in
"/usr/spool/mqueue": No such file or directory' errors in /usr/adm/messages.

I am taking the source home for "queue.c" of sendmail, the routine guilty
of the 'messages' errors.  That may or may not lead to anything.  If
someone has seen this before, I would appreciate you dropping me a line.

i think this error occurs when /usr/spool/mqueue is not writable by
either `daemon' or `uucp'.  check the mode and/or owner of the
directory.

Oh yes, I heard about that recently from someone here, too.  My fault, as I
had added the extra read_something reference so it would accept null includes.

I fixed it in a slightly different way: just remove the #ifdef XFER's from
around the references to read_something, since detecting empty zone files
seems like a desirable feature regardless of whether you use asynchronous
zone transfers.

The correction is already in uc.msc.umn.edu's ~ftp/pub/bind48+xfer.tar.Z
(along with mods to port the resolver to a Cray-2 in case anybody cares).

Subject: Sendmail 5.59 on a Sun 4/280 with Sun OS 4.0


Is anybody out there running Sendmail 5.59 on a Sun 4 with SunOS 4.0?
If so, would you be willing to answer some questions?  If so, please send
me some email with an address (a phone number would be great; I will spend
the dimes).

I am using the normal (as distributed) uucp software, and have installed
the 5.59 sendmail.  I am having problems with incoming uucp mail, related
somehow to uux, rmail, and sendmail.  I get "MAIL FAIL" messages in
/usr/spool/uucp/LOGFILE, and 'queuename: Cannot create "qf~Zxxxxx" in
"/usr/spool/mqueue": No such file or directory' errors in /usr/adm/messages.

I am taking the source home for "queue.c" of sendmail, the routine guilty
of the 'messages' errors.  That may or may not lead to anything.  If
someone has seen this before, I would appreciate you dropping me a line.

Thanks,

In regards to running sendmail 5.59 on a sun 4/280 with SunOS 4.0:

Thanks to all who responded.  My sendmail was setuid root.  Seems that
my /usr/spool/mqueue was not writable by group daemon.  Now it is.
Note that I had the same problem with either sun's sendmail or berkeley's
sendmail 5.59.  That makes me feel a little better.

So, things are looking up, I can add my changes I need to sendmail, and I'm
off.

By the way, some of you received my last request 4 times.  So did I.
I only sent it once, and as far as I can tell, it only left my machine
once.  True?  Clues?

Again, thanks.

     Thost is a trivial program that came with an early release (4.5?)
of BIND.  It simply does a gethostby{name,addr} on arguments passed to
it and reports the result.  In the version we have (maybe modified
locally) it will work by just giving the IP address as an argument
(i.e thost 128.10.2.1).  It first does a gethostbyname.  If that does
not return a valid result, it attempts a gethostbyaddr.

	By the way, some of you received my last request 4 times. 

Yes, and this one about six times so far!  The trick to tracking these
down is to look at the Received: lines.  It looks like you have hacked
your sendmail.cf to remove the date and id, but these can be inferred 
from the Message-Id and Date lines.  From these it is clear that
wucs1.wustl.edu is sending it once per hour to ucbarpa.  Possibly you
have the read timeouts set too short.  Take a look at /var/log/syslog,
and try running /usr/lib/sendmail -bp and or /usr/lib/sendmail -q -v to
see what error it thinks is happening.  The problem is that wucs1.wustl.edu
thinks it is a soft error, while ucbarpa goes ahead and delivers the mail
anyway.

In regards to running sendmail 5.59 on a sun 4/280 with SunOS 4.0:

Thanks to all who responded.  My sendmail was setuid root.  Seems that
my /usr/spool/mqueue was not writable by group daemon.  Now it is.
Note that I had the same problem with either sun's sendmail or berkeley's
sendmail 5.59.  That makes me feel a little better.

So, things are looking up, I can add my changes I need to sendmail, and I'm
off.

By the way, some of you received my last request 4 times.  So did I.
I only sent it once, and as far as I can tell, it only left my machine
once.  True?  Clues?

Again, thanks.

Here are some csh aliases shamelessly stolen from Matt Crawford at UChicago
that I've found invaluable time savers when working with nslookup.  The one
for PTR records is particularly useful.

In the README file that came in the BIND 4.8 release, the last paragraph
stated that a version of Sendmail supporting MX records could be found
in ~ftp/pub/4.3/sendmail.MX.tar{.Z} from ucbarpa.Berkeley.Edu via

There is a sendmail.tar{.Z}, which I retreived and have examined. It does
have some type of Domain support, but I haven't (yet) seen expicit MX support
indicated. My question is: Is this sendmail the one refered to

in some other place that has MX support.

At the risk of sending multiple messages again, I am sending this test
message.  I have gone from using 5.59 Sendmail to the sun supported sendmail,
which I was told (by an unadvertised source :-) ) that it is based upon
5.54 sendmail.  I'm not sure what will happen, but I promise that I will
keep a closer eye on it this time.  Apparently sending from 5.59 sendmail
I flooded people time and time again with the message.  I now know that
the message sat in my queue on my machine, received a whole bunch of
"reply: read error" messages, and kept trying to send to bind@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu.

By the way, should my mailer even care that I am sending to a long mailing
list and not to just a single recipient?  I have the feeling that this was
discussed here, but during the transition we made, I think I lost a few
messages.  Sorry if I brought up a "thouroughly" beaten horse.

When using the configuration of server 1 using server 2 as a forwarder
and server 1 being a slave, I found that queries fail the first time
after only 4 seconds.  When I try a query a second time, it succeeds.
I turned on debugging on server 1 and watched it forward a query to
server 2, wait 4 seconds and then give up.

Shouldn't server 1 retry to the forwarder more times when it is a slave?

Whomever,

Is it possible to spoof bind into not going and looking for root servers?
My company is wanting to get a nameserver up and running, Sun requires ARPA
connections, which currently do not have.  Can I get bind to replace the
named from Sun and not look for the root nameservers?

Is there any special licensing requirements for Berkeley software from
commercial customers?

Thanx

Phil,

Your fix for the distributed wildcard problem isn't quite right, though it
should cause you much more relief than pain.

The right thing to do is:

The name server using a wildcard RR should always synthesize an owner
name from the query name.  Thus *'s will only be distributed when *'s
occur in the query name.  This allows you to see if a wildcarded
template is present at the name server (though you have to search down
since multiple label matches may happen).

The template/synthesize property should never be armed unless the name
server is authoritative for the query name.  This effectively says that
you do not use the *ed RRs from the cache.  Never cache *ed RRs (unless
you understand the fine points of this issue.).  Never use their
synthesis property unless they are in authoritative data.

Resolvers are similar.  They should never used cached * RRs to
synthesize new ones.  If they don't cache the *ed RRs there is
no big loss.

Note that you can get *ed answers out of non-VM servers, iff the
question has an explicit * in it.

Subject: domain search interaction with wildcards in sendmail
Cc: jnford@UMAXC.WEEG.UIOWA.EDU
Date: Fri, 20 May 88 09:38:10 EDT

I recently received a question from someone about problems they were
having with sendmail (5.59) and bind (4.8).

The basic problem is they were trying to send mail to u@host.third.dom.ain.
What happened was that wildcards kept matching and the host name was
expanding.  The host name ended up as host.third.dom.ain.dom.ain.dom.ain.

The following RR was in the zone.

	*.dom.ain.	MX	10	forwarder

Sendmail made the queries using the domain searching as follows:

getcanonname() /* canonicalize the name */
    host.third.dom.ain.other.dom.ain	CLASS=IN TYPE=ANY
    host.third.dom.ain.dom.ain	CLASS=IN TYPE=ANY

The first of these failed since there was other data at other.dom.ain.
The second query succeeded and rewrote the host name as queried.  Next,
sendmail tried:

getmxrr()
    host.third.dom.ain.dom.ain.other.dom.ain	CLASS=IN TYPE=MX
    host.third.dom.ain.dom.ain.dom.ain	CLASS=IN TYPE=MX

Again the second one succeeded.  When the mail was delivered finally,
the host was incorrect.  After the mail was sent to the forwarder, the
forwarder did not recognize the name (not upgraded yet to newest versions).

The above description is close to what happened, but I don't know exactly
what was happening in the traces I was sent.  I have worked out parts of
this from understanding how the queries are made.  The worst problem arises
in that all mail matches the wildcards and gets sent to the forwarder even
if it is outside the domain.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this problem.  The
best one I have come up with is to not use wildcards.  Unfortunately, I
don't think this is a great solution.

Cc: ganz@yale-ee-cesun2.arpa, long-morrow@YALE.ARPA


This is just to report a minor warning concerning an incompatibility between
4.8 and 4.5 default domain resolution. The way to avoid the problem is clearly
not to use a 4.5 bind nameserver as a forwardee.

If a bind 4.8 nameserver is used with a forwarding option to a bind 4.5
nameserver, the bind 4.5 nameserver will apply its own default domain rules
on top of what the originator did already.

If the default domains of the two servers differ from each other, this may
have some strange results. If you ask about a non-existing name in the
originator domain a lot of work is being done at the forwardee, if you ask for
a name that exist in both domains, you can get a resolution at the forwardee
by making a request ending in a period (this last result will be different
when forwarding to a 4.8 namesrever!).

 "host-related information" alias record... but it may make the MIT people's
choice seem less arbitrary.  Another use for this kind of feature would be
to equate "my.domain" to "somehost.in.my.domain" -- which people seem to do
now by simply copying selected RR's (esp. the IN A record) from the latter
to the former.  This has the right effect but seems pretty kludgy to me.

In-Reply-To: Your message of Fri, 29 Apr 88 12:06:25 PDT.

It isn't BIND that declares it illegal to have both CNAMEs and other data
for the same name, it is the name-domain system RFC's and common sense.
A name that is an alias is just exactly that: a name that refers to another
name.  The alias cannot have attributes that are additional to or different
from those of the canonical name.  In particular, a CNAME is not an
indirection for some types of queries and not for others.  CNAME
is not host-specific or user-specific, nor are any names in the system.

There are *not* three separate namespaces for hosts, mailboxes and users,
and there is only one CNAME type.  It applies equally to any of the objects
that may be named in this namespace.  Therefore, if you try to use
the same name for different objects with different types of resource
records, all will have to agree on whether the name is canonical or not,
and if it is not, all must use the same canonical name.

This isn't a bug and it isn't a design error.  Don't "fix" it.

	I've seen similar problems here:  I try to telnet to a machine,
	and I get back "unknown host" (this comes back quite quickly,
	so it isn't a resolver timeout).  I try again immediately, and
	it works.  Could this be a related problem?  This has just
	started happening recently (like in the last week).

I have been running the 4.8 BIND server and resolver on Sun.COM for a
few days with no problems.  This machine handles several thousand mail
messages per day.

I did find one "gotcha" in the resolver. The res_send.c module likes to
use connect() a lot, even on UDP sockets.  This is #ifdef'ed on BSD >=
43, but we were defining BSD to be 43 to get the new h_adddr_list
declaration.  However, on SunOS 3.x (and other 4.2BSD systems) multiple
connects do not work.  After the first one, the others return with
errors real fast, and you get the behavior that you describe if the
first transmission times out (which can happen reasonably fast). The
solution is to compile the resolver with BSD defined to be 42, since
gethostnamadr.c now has an || defined(h_addr) to handle the case when
you want 4.3BSD netdb.h on a 4.2BSD kernel.  SunOS 4.x and 4.3BSD of
course do not have this problem.

I'm testing bind 4.8 on my gateway (vax).  It's been running for a few days.
Every day, someone has reported an instance when the machine didn't know
the address of another one of our internal machines.  (Ex.  An rsh failed
with host unknown or a rlogin to the gateway asked for a passwd even though
hosts.equiv is set up to not do that.)

Has anyone else seen this problem?  I really want to keep running 4.8 (was

I've seen something that might be similar -- a 4.8 server here, the only
server for its (fake) domain, seemed to return NXDOMAIN for a name that
was in its database.  Or at least another machine's resolver returned NXDOMAIN.
Before I could get in to track it down (actually run nslookup on the suspect
server) the problem vanished -- i.e. the name "reappeared".

It's conceivable that something flaky happened with the kludge I used to
make our other machines recognize the fake domain, though, so I'm not
-certain- that the 4.8 server was at fault.

From: gbb%fermat@bru.mayo.edu


I just ftp'ed the distribution for bind V4.8 from your machine (as
well as the latest version of TCP/IP.  I have been requested to get
my ULTRIX host up as our primary domain name server, and also get
the mx version of sendmail functioning on it.  I have a V2.2 of
ULTRIX on a VAXstation 2000.  Since we use the IP<->DECnet gateway heavily,
I was wondering if it were possible to install the current distributions
of bind and tcp on the system without causing any critical problems, or
if I can install it at all, given my hardware/software/usage situation?


As I am new to internet functions, and especially name service, I have
little experience in such matters.  I read the accompanying documents to the
various distribution sets, and I become quite pessimistic about the 
probabilities of success.

I guess what I am hoping for is a 'cook-book' implementation guide for bind on
ULTRIX if the procedure is markedly different from what is discussed in the
distribution.  Also, if there are any known problems with implementation on
such a system.  Also, any other sources I could tap for learning more about
integrateing internet functions into my machine.

Thank you for your time.

	I'm testing bind 4.8 on my gateway (vax).  It's been running for a few days.
	Every day, someone has reported an instance when the machine didn't know
	the address of another one of our internal machines.  (Ex.  An rsh failed
	with host unknown or a rlogin to the gateway asked for a passwd even though
	hosts.equiv is set up to not do that.)
	 
	Has anyone else seen this problem?  I really want to keep running 4.8 (was
	running 4.4 before that).
	 
	Tim.
	
I have noticed similar problems at our site where the first
time I try to rlogin to a local machine, it fails, and a few
moments later, presumably after it has looked up the name,
rlogin works.  Same with telnet and ftp and other applications
that use the resolver.  The nifty thing is that it started
appearing recently (around the time that 4.8 came out actually)
even before we upgrade our name server.  Is there some kind of
problem that crops up when different versions of the bind 
server interract?

Philip,

    Yes I'm on the list.  I have not looked at repairing Sendmail --
indeed, Sendmail folk have led me to believe that there are ways to
configure sendmail to avoid the RFC 1047 problems.

    My motivation with RFC1047 came, in part, from my work with MMDF2,
which regularly provokes Sendmail to send multiple messages.

Subject: CNAME and other data - semantic problems
Cc: namedroppers@sri-nic.arpa

We are using BIND to store MB records for mailbox names here at
UCSD - using a variant of NSLOOKUP to provide an on-line electronic
mail directory.

We have a mailbox name "u3g".  We also have a host whose nickname
of "u3g" is recorded as a CNAME entry under its real name.

BIND 4.8 reports this as illegal; I don't think it should be illegal
because of the difference between host-related information (A, WKS,
HINFO, etc) and mailbox-related information (MB, MG, etc).  
I suspect the same separation should exist for user-related data
(UID, GID, UINFO, etc).

It seems to me that we have at least three disjoint namespaces here
- host, mailbox, and user - and that the current version of BIND
does not properly separate them semantically when parsing the input file.

Clearly I can work around this in a way that the Athena people did
- by creating "mailbox.ucsd.edu" and "user.ucsd.edu" domains,
and storing the data under those - but that is just as clearly not
the right way to do it, since I shouldn't have to have separate
subdomains as well as types of RRs.

Since we have lots of personal workstations here, we're going to run
into this more often.  It seems quite reasonable to have a USER "wade",
a MAILBOX "wade", and a HOST "wade".  Yet these are clearly separate
entities, and grouping of data for them between the three namespaces
cannot be assumed.

Before I go hack on the BIND source to fix this, would someone
please let me know if I'm off-base, or whether this is really the
design error I think it is.

Subject: Re:  RFC 1047

RFC 1047 tells how to minimize the length of the synchronization gap, but
how about taking steps to eliminate it?  For example, the SMTP server could
keep a database of message-ID's that it has received in the last day or so
(along with a list of the mail addresses that the message was forwarded to).
If the server later received a duplicate copy of the message that was not
to be forwarded to anyone not on the list for that message, the server would
simply acknowledge and discard the message.

The list of mail addresses that a given message was forwarded to must be kept
in order to handle source routing, for example:

	mail @stanford.edu:someone@sri.com @berkeley.edu:me@sri.com

(In this example, the use of source routing will force sri.com to get
two copies of the message, one that was forwarded through Stanford, the
other that was forwarded through Berkeley.)

Note that this requires no changes to the SMTP standard, and that mailers
that do this can coexist with mailers that do not.

				Thanx, Paul

PS.  Usenet uses a similiar scheme to prevent article duplication.

Not knowing what your configuration I will through out a wild guess.  I
you are acting as a secondary domain server for another your name
server will not respond to requests while the zone transfer is in
progress.  This is especially noticable if the othe name server is not
reachable as this state of catatonia will last until you have timed out
all the addresses listed for the zone to be transfered.  There were a
set of patches against version 4.7.3 posted by the folks at BBN (I do
not remember exaclty who.) that fixed this.

[... BIND 4.8 reports an error when given a CNAME and MB or other data
     for the same name...]

BIND is following the RFCs in reporting this error.  CNAME is not supposed
to be just a host alias, it gives the canonical name for the whole -domain-:
one could interpret
X	CNAME	Y
as meaning "all data pertaining to X is stored under Y's domain entry."

See RFC 1034 page 15, which tells you that if a domain contains a CNAME record
it should contain no other RR's.

This isn't much help in your present situation, where what you really want is
a "host-related information" alias record... but it may make the MIT people's
choice seem less arbitrary.  Another use for this kind of feature would be
to equate "my.domain" to "somehost.in.my.domain" -- which people seem to do
now by simply copying selected RR's (esp. the IN A record) from the latter
to the former.  This has the right effect but seems pretty kludgy to me.

It isn't BIND that declares it illegal to have both CNAMEs and other data
for the same name, it is the name-domain system RFC's and common sense.
A name that is an alias is just exactly that: a name that refers to another
name.  The alias cannot have attributes that are additional to or different
from those of the canonical name.  In particular, a CNAME is not an
indirection for some types of queries and not for others.  CNAME
is not host-specific or user-specific, nor are any names in the system.

There are *not* three separate namespaces for hosts, mailboxes and users,
and there is only one CNAME type.  It applies equally to any of the objects
that may be named in this namespace.  Therefore, if you try to use
the same name for different objects with different types of resource
records, all will have to agree on whether the name is canonical or not,
and if it is not, all must use the same canonical name.

This isn't a bug and it isn't a design error.  Don't "fix" it.

	I've seen similar problems here:  I try to telnet to a machine,
	and I get back "unknown host" (this comes back quite quickly,
	so it isn't a resolver timeout).  I try again immediately, and
	it works.  Could this be a related problem?  This has just
	started happening recently (like in the last week).

I have been running the 4.8 BIND server and resolver on Sun.COM for a
few days with no problems.  This machine handles several thousand mail
messages per day.

I did find one "gotcha" in the resolver. The res_send.c module likes to
use connect() a lot, even on UDP sockets.  This is #ifdef'ed on BSD >=
43, but we were defining BSD to be 43 to get the new h_adddr_list
declaration.  However, on SunOS 3.x (and other 4.2BSD systems) multiple
connects do not work.  After the first one, the others return with
errors real fast, and you get the behavior that you describe if the
first transmission times out (which can happen reasonably fast). The
solution is to compile the resolver with BSD defined to be 42, since
gethostnamadr.c now has an || defined(h_addr) to handle the case when
you want 4.3BSD netdb.h on a 4.2BSD kernel.  SunOS 4.x and 4.3BSD of
course do not have this problem.

I'm testing bind 4.8 on my gateway (vax).  It's been running for a few days.
Every day, someone has reported an instance when the machine didn't know
the address of another one of our internal machines.  (Ex.  An rsh failed
with host unknown or a rlogin to the gateway asked for a passwd even though
hosts.equiv is set up to not do that.)

Has anyone else seen this problem?  I really want to keep running 4.8 (was

I've seen something that might be similar -- a 4.8 server here, the only
server for its (fake) domain, seemed to return NXDOMAIN for a name that
was in its database.  Or at least another machine's resolver returned NXDOMAIN.
Before I could get in to track it down (actually run nslookup on the suspect
server) the problem vanished -- i.e. the name "reappeared".

It's conceivable that something flaky happened with the kludge I used to
make our other machines recognize the fake domain, though, so I'm not
-certain- that the 4.8 server was at fault.

From: Pat Barron <pdb@SEI.CMU.EDU>

I've seen similar problems here:  I try to telnet to a machine, and I get
back "unknown host" (this comes back quite quickly, so it isn't a resolver
timeout).  I try again immediately, and it works.  Could this be a related
problem?  This has just started happening recently (like in the last week).

BTW, I'm (still) running BIND 4.5, so it might not be a BIND 4.8 problem.

Subject: bind.4.8 distribution

From: gbb%fermat@bru.mayo.edu


I just ftp'ed the distribution for bind V4.8 from your machine (as
well as the latest version of TCP/IP.  I have been requested to get
my ULTRIX host up as our primary domain name server, and also get
the mx version of sendmail functioning on it.  I have a V2.2 of
ULTRIX on a VAXstation 2000.  Since we use the IP<->DECnet gateway heavily,
I was wondering if it were possible to install the current distributions
of bind and tcp on the system without causing any critical problems, or
if I can install it at all, given my hardware/software/usage situation?


As I am new to internet functions, and especially name service, I have
little experience in such matters.  I read the accompanying documents to the
various distribution sets, and I become quite pessimistic about the 
probabilities of success.

I guess what I am hoping for is a 'cook-book' implementation guide for bind on
ULTRIX if the procedure is markedly different from what is discussed in the
distribution.  Also, if there are any known problems with implementation on
such a system.  Also, any other sources I could tap for learning more about
integrateing internet functions into my machine.

Thank you for your time.

	Subject: bind 4.8 problem
	
	I'm testing bind 4.8 on my gateway (vax).  It's been running for a few days.
	Every day, someone has reported an instance when the machine didn't know
	the address of another one of our internal machines.  (Ex.  An rsh failed
	with host unknown or a rlogin to the gateway asked for a passwd even though
	hosts.equiv is set up to not do that.)
	 
	Has anyone else seen this problem?  I really want to keep running 4.8 (was
	running 4.4 before that).
	 
	Tim.
	
I have noticed similar problems at our site where the first
time I try to rlogin to a local machine, it fails, and a few
moments later, presumably after it has looked up the name,
rlogin works.  Same with telnet and ftp and other applications
that use the resolver.  The nifty thing is that it started
appearing recently (around the time that 4.8 came out actually)
even before we upgrade our name server.  Is there some kind of
problem that crops up when different versions of the bind 
server interract?

Philip,

    Yes I'm on the list.  I have not looked at repairing Sendmail --
indeed, Sendmail folk have led me to believe that there are ways to
configure sendmail to avoid the RFC 1047 problems.

    My motivation with RFC1047 came, in part, from my work with MMDF2,
which regularly provokes Sendmail to send multiple messages.

Subject: CNAME and other data - semantic problems
Cc: namedroppers@sri-nic.arpa

We are using BIND to store MB records for mailbox names here at
UCSD - using a variant of NSLOOKUP to provide an on-line electronic
mail directory.

We have a mailbox name "u3g".  We also have a host whose nickname
of "u3g" is recorded as a CNAME entry under its real name.

BIND 4.8 reports this as illegal; I don't think it should be illegal
because of the difference between host-related information (A, WKS,
HINFO, etc) and mailbox-related information (MB, MG, etc).  
I suspect the same separation should exist for user-related data
(UID, GID, UINFO, etc).

It seems to me that we have at least three disjoint namespaces here
- host, mailbox, and user - and that the current version of BIND
does not properly separate them semantically when parsing the input file.

Clearly I can work around this in a way that the Athena people did
- by creating "mailbox.ucsd.edu" and "user.ucsd.edu" domains,
and storing the data under those - but that is just as clearly not
the right way to do it, since I shouldn't have to have separate
subdomains as well as types of RRs.

Since we have lots of personal workstations here, we're going to run
into this more often.  It seems quite reasonable to have a USER "wade",
a MAILBOX "wade", and a HOST "wade".  Yet these are clearly separate
entities, and grouping of data for them between the three namespaces
cannot be assumed.

Before I go hack on the BIND source to fix this, would someone
please let me know if I'm off-base, or whether this is really the
design error I think it is.

Subject: Re:  RFC 1047

RFC 1047 tells how to minimize the length of the synchronization gap, but
how about taking steps to eliminate it?  For example, the SMTP server could
keep a database of message-ID's that it has received in the last day or so
(along with a list of the mail addresses that the message was forwarded to).
If the server later received a duplicate copy of the message that was not
to be forwarded to anyone not on the list for that message, the server would
simply acknowledge and discard the message.

The list of mail addresses that a given message was forwarded to must be kept
in order to handle source routing, for example:

	mail @stanford.edu:someone@sri.com @berkeley.edu:me@sri.com

(In this example, the use of source routing will force sri.com to get
two copies of the message, one that was forwarded through Stanford, the
other that was forwarded through Berkeley.)

Note that this requires no changes to the SMTP standard, and that mailers
that do this can coexist with mailers that do not.

				Thanx, Paul

PS.  Usenet uses a similiar scheme to prevent article duplication.

[... BIND 4.8 reports an error when given a CNAME and MB or other data
     for the same name...]

BIND is following the RFCs in reporting this error.  CNAME is not supposed
to be just a host alias, it gives the canonical name for the whole -domain-:
one could interpret
X	CNAME	Y
as meaning "all data pertaining to X is stored under Y's domain entry."

See RFC 1034 page 15, which tells you that if a domain contains a CNAME record
it should contain no other RR's.

This isn't much help in your present situation, where what you really want is
a "host-related information" alias record... but it may make the MIT people's
choice seem less arbitrary.  Another use for this kind of feature would be
to equate "my.domain" to "somehost.in.my.domain" -- which people seem to do
now by simply copying selected RR's (esp. the IN A record) from the latter
to the former.  This has the right effect but seems pretty kludg
